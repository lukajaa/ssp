# Car Dependency in San Francisco

This is a website for my Senior Signature Project at The Bay School of San Francisco. It provides background information on transportation in San Francisco, and then focuses on the car dependency in the city. It also provides action steps that can be taken to reduce car dependency in San Francisco. Finally, there are plenty of interactive maps and graphs to help visualize the data.
