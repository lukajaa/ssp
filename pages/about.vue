    <p class="mt-2 indent-8">
      This website aims to provide a introductory level of understanding of car
      dependency in the United States and specifically San Francisco.
      Furthermore, this website promotes action to reduce car dependency and
      increase the use of public transportation and other sustainable modes of
      transportation. Importantly, this website does not aim to shame or blame
      individuals for their car usage, but rather to provide information and
      resources to help individuals make more sustainable transportation
      choices. It's not about being perfect, it's about doing what you can.
      Hopefully, this website will help you do just that.
