    <Paragraph>
      By the late 1900s, people began to realize that cars were not the best way
      to get around. They were expensive, dangerous, and bad for the
      environment. Many cities began to invest in public transit and bike
      networks. However, the damage had already been done. Many cities were
      already designed around cars, and it was difficult to work around their
      <PopupCard term="car-centric design" />. Furthermore, the love of cars was
      already deeply ingrained in American culture. The car was and still stands
      as a symbol of freedom and independence,and is the default mode of
      transportation for most Americans.

    <Paragraph>
      Now, many cities are attempting to adapt to less car-dependent systems
      within their current infrastructure. This is a difficult task, but it is
      necessary to create a more sustainable future. In San Francisco, certain
      streets are closed to any non-resident or delivery traffic. Furthermore,
      on many main streets, their are dedicated lanes for bus and bike traffic.
      On Market Street, one of the biggest streets in SF, traffic is closed to
      all private vehicles. This is a great example of how cities can adapt to a
      less car-dependent future.
